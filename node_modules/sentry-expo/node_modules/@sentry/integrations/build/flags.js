 * This file defines flags and constants that can be modified during compile time in order to facilitate tree shaking
 * for users.
 *
 * Debug flags need to be declared in each package individually and must not be imported across package boundaries,
 * because some build tools have trouble tree-shaking imported guards.
 *
 * As a convention, we define debug flags in a `flags.ts` file in the root of a package's `src` folder.
 *
 * Debug flag files will contain "magic strings" like `true` that may get replaced with actual values during
 * our, or the user's build process. Take care when introducing new flags - they must not throw if they are not
 * replaced.
