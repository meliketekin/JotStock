# sentry-expo

## Keep 🐛🐜🐞 out of your app

Bugs can be [really cool](https://www.cbc.ca/kidscbc2/the-feed/14-of-the-worlds-weirdest-insects), but not when it comes to your app.

That's where `sentry-expo` comes in! Keep a close eye on your app, whether it's in development, staging, or production, by getting real-time insight into errors and bugs. That way, you can quickly reproduce, fix, and re-deploy!

## 🤔 How do I use this?

<details>
<summary>Hey- before you actually use Sentry, make sure you've created a Sentry project. How do you do that? Open this drop-down to find out!</summary>

🚨 Creating a Sentry project

Before getting real-time updates on errors and making your app generally incredible, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. [Sign up for Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/) (it's free), and create a project in your Dashboard. Take note of your organization name, and project name.
2. Take note of your `DSN`, you'll need it later
3. Go to the [Sentry API section](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/), and create an auth token (Ensure you have `project:write` selected under scopes). Save this, too.

Once you have each of these: organization name, project name, DSN, and auth token, you're all set!

</details>

### Step 1: Installation

In your project directory, run

```sh
expo install sentry-expo
```

`sentry-expo` requires some additional dependencies, so you should also run

```sh
expo install expo-application expo-constants expo-device expo-updates @sentry/react-native
```

> If you don't have `expo-cli` installed, [you should](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/)! But you can also just install with `yarn` or `npm`.

### Step 2: Code

Add the following to your app's main file (usually `App.js`):

```js
import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR DSN HERE',
  enableInExpoDevelopment: true,
  debug: true, // If `true`, Sentry will try to print out useful debugging information if something goes wrong with sending the event. Set it to `false` in production
});

// Access any @sentry/react-native exports via:
Sentry.Native.*

// Access any @sentry/browser exports via:
Sentry.Browser.*
```

### Step 3: App Config

#### Configure your `postPublish` hook

Add `expo.hooks` to your project's `app.json` (or `app.config`) file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ... your existing configuration
    "hooks": {
      "postPublish": [
        {
          "file": "sentry-expo/upload-sourcemaps",
          "config": {
            "organization": "your sentry organization's short name here",
            "project": "your sentry project's name here",
            "authToken": "your auth token here"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Add the Config Plugin

> Note: Disregard the following if you're using the classic build system (`expo build:[android|ios]`).

Add `expo.plugins` to your project's `app.json` (or `app.config`) file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ... your existing configuration
    "plugins": ["sentry-expo"]
  }
}
```

> If you directly edit your native `ios/` and `android/` directories (i.e. you have ejected your project, or have a bare workflow project), you should instead use `yarn sentry-wizard -i reactNative -p ios android` to configure your native projects.

## "No publish builds"

> Note: Disregard the following if you're using the classic build system (`expo build:[android|ios]`).

With `expo-updates`, release builds of both iOS and Android apps will create and embed a new update from your JavaScript source at build-time. **This new update will not be published automatically** and will exist only in the binary with which it was bundled. Since it isn't published, the sourcemaps aren't uploaded in the usual way like they are when you run `expo publish` (actually, we are relying on Sentry's native scripts to handle that). Because of this you have some extra things to be aware of:

- Your `release` will automatically be set to Sentry's expected value- `${bundleIdentifier}@${version}+${buildNumber}` (iOS) or `${androidPackage}@${version}+${versionCode}` (Android).
- Your `dist` will automatically be set to Sentry's expected value- `${buildNumber}` (iOS) or `${versionCode}` (Android).
- The configuration for build time sourcemaps comes from the `ios/sentry.properties` and `android/sentry.properties` files. For more information, refer to [Sentry's documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/config/#configuration-via-properties-file). If you're using the managed workflow, then we handle setting these values for your via the `plugin` you added above.

> Please note that configuration for `expo publish` and `expo export` in bare and managed is still done via `app.json`.

Skipping or misconfiguring either of these will result in sourcemaps not working, and thus you won't see proper stacktraces in your errors.

### Self-hosting OTA?

If you're self-hosting your Over the Air Updates (this means you run `expo export` instead of `expo publish`), you need to:

- replace `hooks.postPublish` in your `app.json` file with `hooks.postExport` (everything else stays the same)
- add the `RewriteFrames` integration to your `Sentry.init` call like so:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: SENTRY_DSN,
  enableInExpoDevelopment: true,
  integrations: [
    new RewriteFrames({
      iteratee: (frame) => {
        if (frame.filename) {
          // the values depend on what names you give the bundle files you are uploading to Sentry
          frame.filename =
            Platform.OS === 'android' ? 'app:///index.android.bundle' : 'app:///main.jsbundle';
        }
        return frame;
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
